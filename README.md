## Weather report

It is another weather report tool for people (mainly me) to use. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯.


The reports not only shows the weather but also the air quality. Forest fire has become a serious issue over past few years. I built this site to help me understand the air quality of the day. It evolved to allowing me to search for other cities.


The default location is an approximation based on your IP (thanks to Cloudflare ðŸŽ‰). But you can also search for other cities/addresses.


The site built with [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler) and runs on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler) is used to dev, build and publish the entire site. The data are from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/). 2 awesome open API projects for weather and geoencoding. Their responses are cached for 5 minutes using [Cloudflare Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) so the site does not accidentally ddos the servers.
